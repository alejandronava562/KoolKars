## Welcome to KoolKars

This gallery should contain a variety of different car images.

Cars are universally used in every country of the world. Not only because they're useful, but because they're stylish.

This website aims to illustrate that.

### The Classic

Everywhere in America, the Ford Mustang has become a staple in the muscle car community. The horsepower, the design, and the roar of the engine make this car a favorite amongst muscle car lovers. I prefer the classic design of the Ford Mustang over the modern.
